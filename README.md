An algorithm for linking a mention in text to an entity in [wikidata]([url](http://wikidata.org/)http://wikidata.org/). 

# Prerequisites
1. Python https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Pip (add pip to system path) - most versions of python do this automatically.
Run pip on the command prompt to see if it's installed

# Warnings 
1. The project installs dependencies automatically if prerequisites are installed well.
2. This has been tested only on windows and may break on linux

# Run 
To get entities from wikidata into our local database 'source.db'

```py run.py```

# Output
You can check the entities that have matches with 

```py utils.py```

The output is shown in output.xlsx as in below:
